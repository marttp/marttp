## For Startup founder

> Since I have my own direction, I might not be interesting in the opportunity of full-time work in a startup company.
However, If you still prefer me, interested in my project, looking for my contribution to your business, and pay me for each project instead of stock options.
I'm ok to do so by project and I will spent my time after work or on weekend. I want to pursue a higher degree by funding myself. 🙇‍♂️

I can contribute your Java/Kotlin/Rust/C#/JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Actually, If you prefer other technology, I'm still ok. I'm an all-around backend development.
